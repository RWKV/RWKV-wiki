# Ai00

## Introduction

The Ai00 Server is an inference API server for the RWKV language model, based on the web-rwkv inference engine. It is also an open-source software licensed under the MIT license, developed by the Ai00-x development team led by members of the RWKV open-source community, [@cryscan](https://github.com/cryscan) and [@顾真牛](https://github.com/cgisky1980).

The Ai00 Server supports Vulkan as the inference backend and enables Vulkan parallel and concurrent batch inference. It can run on all GPUs that support Vulkan. In fact, the Ai00 Server is compatible with most NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel graphics cards (including integrated graphics cards).

While offering high compatibility, the Ai00 Server does not require bulky environments like PyTorch, CUDA, and other runtimes. It has a compact structure, is ready to use out of the box, and supports INT8/NF4 quantization, allowing it to run at high speed on most personal computers.

The repository address of the Ai00 Server: <https://github.com/Ai00-X/ai00_server>

This beginner's tutorial aims to provide guidance for those who are new to the RWKV large model and the Ai00 Server. By following the steps in this article, you should be able to successfully run the RWKV model locally using the Ai00 Server and perform various tasks, including chatting, text generation, translation, and question answering.

## Simple Usage

### VRAM Requirements of Ai00

The following are the VRAM requirements for different quantization methods of Ai00:

::: tip
Test environment:
- CPU: i7-10870H
- GPU: RTX 4090, 24G VRAM
- Memory: 32GB
:::

| Quantization Method | 1B6 Model | 3B Model | 7B Model | 14B Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| FP16 | 3.2GB VRAM | 6.5GB VRAM | 14.4GB VRAM | Approximately 29G VRAM |
| INT8 | 2GB VRAM | 4.4GB VRAM | 8.2GB VRAM | 14.8GB VRAM |
| NF4 | 1.3GB VRAM | 2.6GB VRAM | 5.2GB VRAM | 10.4GB VRAM |

::: warning
All layers are quantized by default. The higher the number of quantized layers, the lower the VRAM usage, but the performance of the model may deteriorate.
:::

## Download/Convert RWKV Model

The Ai00 Server currently only supports Safetensors models with the `.st` file extension. There are two ways to obtain a `.st` model.

::: tip
If you don't have any model weights locally, it is recommended to directly download the `.st` model from the repository. If you already have a `.pth` file locally, you can convert the `.pth` file to a `.st` file according to the following conversion tutorial.

:::
::: tabs

@tab Directly Download the .st Model (Recommended Method)
Download the already converted `.st` model from the following repositories:

- [RWKV-7 ModelScope Repository](https://modelscope.cn/models/shoumenchougou/RWKV-7-World-ST/files) (Recommended)
- [RWKV-6 ModelScope Repository](https://modelscope.cn/models/shoumenchougou/RWKV-6-World-ST/files)

@tab Convert the .pth Model to a .st Model
First, go to the [Python](https://www.python.org) official website to download and install Python, and then use `pip` to install the required libraries:

```bash copy
pip install numpy torch safetensors
```

Then move the `.pth` file to the `dist/assets/scripts` directory. Start the terminal and execute the following command to convert the specified `.pth` model into a `.st` model:

```bash copy
python convert_safetensors.py --input ./model.pth --output ./model.st
```

::: tip
Please change `./model.pth` in the above command to the `.pth` model file that needs to be converted;
At the same time, change `./model.st` to the target `.st` model file.

The following is an example of a successful run. Note that you need to use the `./` relative path, otherwise some systems cannot directly read the current file path.

![ai00-transform-example](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-transform-example.png)

:::

After obtaining the RWKV model with the `.st` file extension, create a new `models` folder in the `dist/assets` directory of Ai00 and place the RWKV model in this folder.

![ai00-create-model-dir](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-create-model-dir.png)

### Adjust Configuration Parameters

The Ai00 program will run the `RWKV` model according to the parameters in the `assets/configs/Config.toml` configuration file. You can modify the configuration items in `Config.toml` through a text editing software (such as Notepad) to adjust the running effect of the model.

The following is a sample `Config.toml` configuration.

``` bash copy

After modifying the configuration items, save the `Config.toml` file and double-click to run the `ai00_server.exe` program.

When the prompt `INFO  [ai00_server::middleware] model loaded` appears in the command line, it means that the model has been loaded successfully:

![ai00-model-loaded](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-model-loaded.png)

At this time, open any browser and visit `http://localhost:65530` to open the Ai00 Web interface.

::: warning
If you set `tls = true` in the config file, please visit `https://localhost:65530`.

## Adjust the Decoding Parameters on the Right

There are some model decoding parameters that can be set on the right side of the Web page, such as `Temperature`, `Top_P`, `Presence Penalty`, and `Frequency Penalty`. Adjusting these parameters will affect the generation results of the model.

The effects corresponding to the parameters are as follows:

| Parameter | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `Top_P` | Select the top $N$ tokens whose cumulative probability reaches the value of $P$ as the candidate set. For example, if it is set to 0.1, the top 10% will be considered, resulting in higher-quality but more conservative generated content. If it is set to 1, the content quality will decrease but become more diverse. |
| `Temperature` | The temperature parameter $T$ controls the randomness of the generation results by modifying the scaling ratio of the logits. A high temperature will make the probability distribution more uniform, increasing the randomness of the generated content; a low temperature will make the model more likely to choose the token with the highest probability. |
| `Presence penalty` | Presence penalty applies a **fixed penalty** to **all tokens that have appeared**, thereby increasing the possibility of the model generating new tokens. |
| `Frequency Penalty` | Frequency penalty applies an **accumulative penalty** based on **the number of times a token appears**, thereby reducing the possibility of the model frequently repeating the same content. |
| `max_tokens` | The maximum number of tokens when the model generates text, which can be understood as "the maximum number of characters the model can generate at one time". |

::: tip
For a more detailed explanation of the decoding parameters and parameter recommendations, refer to [RWKV's Decoding Parameters](https://wiki.rwkv.com/RWKV-Prompts/RWKV-Parameters).

---

In addition to driving the RWKV model for conversations and text continuation, Ai00 has many advanced features, such as mounting State files, LoRA files, and using BNF.

You can return to this page when a new version of Ai00 is released to view the latest features of Ai00.

### Mount a State File [Version 0.4.9]

Mounting a State file can enhance the model's performance on a specific type of task. Taking a State that enhances single-round Q&A + emoji as an example, for the same question "How to get from Tokyo to Paris", the style of the model's answers before and after mounting the State is completely different:

**Without mounting a State file:**

![state-file-usage](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-answer-without-state.png)

**After mounting the State file for "Enhanced Single-Round English Conversation + Emoji":**

![state-file-usage](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-answer-with-state.png)

#### Download a State File

The Ai00 Server currently only supports State files with the `.state` extension. You can download `.state` files from the [HF repository](https://huggingface.co/shoumenchougou/RWKV-6-State-for-st/tree/main).

If you cannot access the above website, please visit the [HF mirror site](https://hf-mirror.com/shoumenchougou/RWKV-6-State-for-st/tree/main).

#### How to Mount a State File

Modify the parameters related to mounting a State in the `Config.toml` configuration file: Remove the `#` comment symbol and modify the corresponding parameters.

The reference configuration information is as follows:

```bash copy
[[state]] # Whether to mount a state
# id = "fd7a60ed-7807-449f-8256-bccae3246222"   # Generally, do not specify the UUID in a non-development environment. You can keep the comment symbol.
name = "x060-7B-Chinese"  # Name this state file "x060-7B-Chinese"
path = "rwkv-x060-chn_single_round_qa-7B-20240516-ctx2048.state" # The name of the state file, stored in the `model` folder
```

After starting the RWKV model, you can switch the State file in the upper right corner of the WebUI interface.

#### Precautions for Mounting a State File

::: warning
Note: When mounting a state file, you must use the base RWKV model with the same parameters as the State file.
:::

For example, if this State file is fine-tuned based on the `RWKV-6-World-7B` model, then you must start the `RWKV-6-World-7B` model in Ai00 for the mounted State file to take effect.

![state-file-usage](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-state-file-usage.png)

::: tip
As of version 0.5.0 of Ai00, it is supported to dynamically switch States in the upper right of the WebUI - Chat mode, but it is not supported to mount multiple States simultaneously.
:::

![ai00-change-state](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-change-state.png)

---

### Mount a LoRA Model [Version 0.4.9]

Mounting a LoRA model has a similar effect to mounting a State, which can also enhance the model's performance on a certain type of task.

#### How to Mount a LoRA Model?

You can modify the parameters for mounting a LoRA model in the `Config.toml` file configuration:

```bash copy
# [[lora]] # Whether to enable LoRA by default
# alpha = 192 # The larger the alpha value, the greater the influence of LoRA on the model output.
# path = "assets/models/rwkv-x060-3b.lora" # The path of the LoRA file
```

To enable the LoRA mounting function, remove the `#` comment symbol and modify the corresponding parameters. Refer to the following:

```bash copy
[[lora]] # Enable LoRA by default
# alpha = 192 # The larger the alpha value, the greater the influence of LoRA on the model output.
path = "assets/models/rwkv-x060-3b.lora" # The path of the LoRA file
```

#### Precautions for Mounting a LoRA File

::: warning
Similar to mounting a state, when mounting a LoRA file, you must use the base RWKV model with the same parameters as the LoRA model.
:::

For example, if this LoRA file is fine-tuned based on the `RWKV-6-World-3B` model, then you must start the `RWKV-6-World-3B` model in Ai00 for the mounted LoRA file to take effect.

![ai00-LoRA-file-usage](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-LoRA-file-usage.png)

::: tip
As of version 0.5.0 of Ai00, it is supported to load multiple LoRAs simultaneously in the WebUI, but it is not supported to dynamically switch LoRAs in the WebUI.

This means that to cancel a LoRA, you must restart the Ai00 service.
:::

---

#### BNF (Backus-Naur Form) [Version 0.4.9]

BNF can force the model to output in the format you want (for example, JSON, markdown with specified fields).

The following is an example of a JSON BNF that contains the fields `name`, `age`, and `job`:

```rust copy
start ::= json_object;
json_object ::= "{\n" object_members "\n}";
object_members ::= json_member | json_member ",\n" object_members;
json_member ::= "\t" json_key ": " json_value;
json_key ::= '"' "name" '"' | '"' "age" '"' | '"' "job" '"';
json_value ::= json_string | json_number;
json_string ::= '"'content'"';
content ::= #"\\w*";
json_number ::= positive_digit digits|'0';
digits ::= digit|digit digits;
digit ::= '0'|positive_digit;
positive_digit::="1"|"2"|"3"|"4"|"5"|"6"|"7"|"8"|"9";
```

Using this prompt, the model will output text in JSON format:

```bash copy
User: Create a profile for John with name, age and job, in json format.

Assistant:
```

![ai00-bnf](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-bnf.png)

---

### Use a Quantized Model in Prefab Format [Version 0.4.9]

::: tip
**What is the prefab format? What is the use of the RWKV model in prefab format?**

The `.prefab` prefab usually refers to a resource format used in game development, which allows developers to create, save, and reuse the configurations of game objects (GameObjects) and their components.

Ai00 supports importing and exporting RWKV models in the `.prefab` format. This format can include the quantization type and the number of quantized layers, thereby saving the online quantization time when loading the RWKV model.
:::

In the WebUI - Setting interface of Ai00, you can export the currently loaded RWKV model in the `.prefab` format, along with the quantization type and the number of quantized layers.

![ai00-prefab-export](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-prefab-export.png)

In the `Config.toml` configuration file, you can use the RWKV model in the `.prefab` format by modifying the model path parameter.

``` bash copy
# [[model]]
path = "rwkv-x060-3b.prefab" # Specify the path of the RWKV model in prefab format
```

::: tip
When using the RWKV model in the `.prefab` format, there is no need to specify the quantization type and the number of quantized layers. The model will automatically load the quantization information recorded in the prefab file.
:::

## Sampling Methods of Ai00

Ai00 uses the Nucleus (also known as top_k) sampling method by default, which is also the default decoding method of the RWKV model. However, in addition to Nucleus, Ai00 also supports two other sampling methods, Mirostat and Typical.

Different sampling methods have different decoding parameters. Adjusting various decoding parameters of the model will affect indicators such as the content style and quality of the model's generated output.

The following is a brief description of the three sampling methods of Ai00 and the corresponding model decoding parameters:

### Nucleus Sampling

The Nucleus (also known as top_k) sampling method selects the words generated by the model through cumulative probability (top_p), ensuring that the text is diverse and does not deviate from the topic.

The Nucleus sampling method supports the following decoding parameters:

| Parameter Name          | Type    | Parameter Explanation                                                                             |
| ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| frequency_penalty       | number  | Presence penalty, penalizes words that **have already appeared** to reduce the chance of their reappearance. |
| penalty                 | integer | Penalty half-life. The model adjusts the penalty_decay after outputting enough words. **It is not recommended to modify this parameter.** |
| penalty_decay           | number  | Decay parameter for frequency, gradually reducing the penalty value in each generation step, ranging from [0.99, 0.999]. **It is not recommended to modify this parameter.** |
| presence_penalty        | number  | Frequency penalty, penalizes words that **appear more frequently** to reduce the chance of their frequent reappearance. |
| temperature             | number  | Sampling temperature (which can be understood as randomness). The larger the value, the stronger the randomness and creativity, but it may also lead to incoherence in the context. |
| top_k                   | integer | The number of candidate words when the model generates content (similar to the number of candidate words in an input method). |
| top_p                   | number  | The cumulative probability of the model's generation. The larger this value, the more diverse the generated content, but it is also more likely to deviate from the conversation topic or even produce nonsensical output. |

In an API request of Ai00, the standard Nucleus sampling format is as follows:

``` json copy
{
  "sampler_override": {
    "frequency_penalty": 0.3,
    "penalty": 400, 
    "penalty_decay": 0.99654026,
    "presence_penalty": 0.3,
    "temperature": 1,
    "top_k": 128,
    "top_p": 0.5,
    "type": "Nucleus"
  }
}
```

### Mirostat Sampling

Mirostat sampling balances creativity and coherence by dynamically adjusting the entropy (randomness).

| Parameter Name | Type   | Parameter Explanation                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rate           | number | The speed at which the model adjusts the randomness. A higher Rate value will make the model adapt to the new context faster, but it may lead to incoherence in the topic of the answer. |
| tau            | number | The target randomness when the model generates text. A higher tau value will result in more creative and diverse text generated by the model, but it may lead to less coherent content. |

In an API request of Ai00, the standard Mirostat sampling format is as follows:

``` json copy
{
  "sampler_override": {
    "Rate": 0.09,
    "tau": 0.5,
    "type": "Mirostat"
  }
}
```

### Typical Sampling

Typical sampling selects the most representative words in the context to avoid the derailment of content caused by extreme probabilities.

| Parameter Name          | Type    | Parameter Explanation                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| frequency_penalty       | number  | Presence penalty, penalizes words that **have already appeared** to reduce the chance of their reappearance. |
| penalty                 | integer | Penalty half-life. The model adjusts the penalty_decay after outputting enough words. **It is not recommended to modify this parameter.** |
| penalty_decay           | number  | Decay parameter for frequency, gradually reducing the penalty value in each generation step, ranging from [0.99, 0.999]. **It is not recommended to modify this parameter.** |
| presence_penalty        | number  | Frequency penalty, penalizes words that **appear more frequently** to reduce the chance of their frequent reappearance. |
| temperature             | number  | Sampling temperature (which can be understood as randomness). The larger the value, the stronger the randomness and creativity, but it may also lead to incoherence in the context. |
| top_k                   | integer | The number of candidate words when the model generates content (similar to the number of candidate words in an input method). |
| tau                     | number  | The target randomness when the model generates text. A higher tau value will result in more creative and diverse text generated by the model, but it may lead to less coherent content. |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Failed to Load When Accessing `https://localhost:65530`**

A: If you have set `tls = false` in `Config.toml`, you need to change https to http, that is, access `http://localhost:65530`.

**Why is TLS still enabled when I change `tls=true` to `tls=false` in the config during startup?**

A: If ACME is set, TLS will be enabled regardless.

**It runs successfully on my own computer but reports an error on some cloud platforms.**

A: The cloud platform may not support Vulkan, and you need to check if Vulkan is available.

**Why does it feel like only one graphics card is working when running AI00 while my computer has multiple graphics cards?**

A: AI00 does not support multi-graphics card inference for now.

**Error: ERROR [ai00 server::middleware] reload model failed: failed to request adaptor**

![alt text](./imgs-of-Ai00/Ai00-qa.png)

A: This is because the device lacks the Vulkan driver. Please install the latest version of the driver.

**Does AI00 support CUDA drivers?**

A: No, it doesn't. AI00 supports Vulkan as the inference backend. It once supported Dx12/openGL, but it does not support CUDA drivers.

**Why does it seem that the speed becomes slower after I use shared video memory?**

![alt text](./imgs-of-Ai00/ai00-qa1.png)

A: Once shared video memory is used, the running speed will be 20 times slower. This is due to the working principle of computer hardware and is not a bug.
