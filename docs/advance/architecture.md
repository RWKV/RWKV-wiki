# RWKV Architecture History

::: tip
If you are not familiar with machine learning, I would highly recommend [Andrej Karpathy's series on neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&ab_channel=AndrejKarpathy) - that would help provide a good foundation on various neural network architecture concepts.
:::

The following is knowledge related to the RWKV architecture, including the origin of the RWKV architecture name, RWKV architecture features, architecture history, and model releases for each architecture.

**RWKV is a variant of RNN**. Therefore, it is necessary to first introduce: What is the RNN architecture, and what is the hidden state of the RNN architecture?

## RNN Architecture and Hidden State

Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) is a neural network model widely used in the field of deep learning.

During the operation of the RNN network, a hidden state (state) is maintained, which can be regarded as the "mental state" of the RNN model.  When humans think, the brain retains the "key information" most relevant to the current event. As the content of thinking changes, the "key information" in our minds is constantly updated. Similarly, the RNN network  **continuously updates its hidden state through specific functions**.

![Classic RNN Diagram](../img/architecture/classic-RNN.png)

As shown in the figure, the RNN network processes each input token in sequence and predicts the next possible token (if needed) based on the "current hidden state". After processing a token, the RNN feeds the result back to the neural network, thereby "updating its hidden state"; then, RNN uses the "updated state" to predict the next token. This cycle continues until the "task completion" state is reached.

::: info
As a variant of RNN, RWKV supports fine-tuning of the hidden state ([state tuning](https://github.com/JL-er/RWKV-PEFT/blob/main/scripts/demo-state-tuning.sh)). After tuned with specific "mental state", RWKV performs better on various downstream tasks.
:::

## What does RWKV stands for

The name of the RWKV architecture comes from the four main parameters used in the time-mixing and channel-mixing blocks:

- $R$: The **Receptance** vector controls the receptance of past information.
- $W$: The **Weight** signifies the positional weight decay vector, a trainable parameter within the model.
- $K$:  The **Key** vector functions similar to K in Attention 
- $V$: The **Value** vector functions similar to V in Attention.


## Development History of the RWKV Architecture

In 2020, BlinkDL began researching Transformers and immediately discovered two obvious improvement directions: introducing explicit decay and Token-shift (or short convolution). After testing on [https://github.com/BlinkDL/minGPT-tuned](https://github.com/BlinkDL/minGPT-tuned), he found that these techniques significantly improved the performance of Transformers.

Later, he noticed Apple's [Attention Free Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14103) (AFT) paper and tested it, finding that these two techniques also brought significant performance improvements to AFT.

### RWKV-V1

In August 2021, the first version of the RWKV architecture: RWKV-V1 released on [**RWKV-LM repository**](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM). The [**first commit**](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM/commit/4c6db5607c6f94c38c10004efb292510bc71ba59) of RWKV-V1 was on August 9, 2021.

RWKV-V1 uses long convolution instead of the Attention mechanism while its architecture consists of alternating Time-mix and Channel-mix. **Channel-mix is a variant of the Transformer's GeGLU layer. Time-mix is a significant improvement over AFT**:

$$
\text { Time-mix }: \mathbf{TM}_{t, c}=\operatorname{sigmoid}\left(R_{t, c}\right) \cdot \sum_{u} W_{t, u, c} \cdot \operatorname{softmax}_{t}\left(K_{u, c}\right) \cdot V_{u, c}
$$

$$
\text { Channel-mix } \mathbf{CM}_{t, c}=\operatorname{sigmoid}\left(R_{t, c}\right) \cdot \sum_{d} W_{c, d} \cdot \operatorname{gelu}\left(K_{t, d}\right) \cdot V_{t, d}
$$

where $R$, $K$, $V$ are generated by linear transformation of the input, and $W$ is the convolution kernel in the long convolution.

::: tip
The structure design of Time-mix and Channel-mix is based on the four main parameters $R$, $W$, $K$, $V$, which is the origin of the name **RWKV**.
:::

::: warning
RWKV-V1 is closer to Linear Transformer rather than RNN, as each time step depends on all previous inputs.

### RWKV-V2-RNN

The RWKV-V2 version was the first RNN model of RWKV, with the pseudo-code diagram as follows:

![RWKV-v2-RNN-Architecture](../img/architecture/RWKV-v2-RNN-Architecture.png)

**Supplementary explanation of the code diagram:**

- a and b are the EMA (exponential moving average) of kv and k
- c and d are a and b plus the pure self-attention effect (self-attention at the same position)
- c / d is the memory mechanism: if a character has a strong k in a certain channel and W is close to 1, the character will be remembered by the subsequent text
- $T$, $K$, $V$, $R$, $W$, $X$, $P$ are trainable parameters
- $W$ is initialized with precomputed values, similar to Alibi (Attention with Linear Biases), but they are trainable non-fixed values and can be different in each channel. This design significantly enhances expressive power of model.
- **Invented a headQK mechanism**, allowing the model to directly copy or avoid generating certain characters from previous text. This mechanism  is important for ICL (in-context learning) and was found by other researchers years later. However, to push the limits of pure RNN model, the main RWKV model never equipped this feature.

```python
q = self.head_q(x)[:,:T,:] 
k = self.head_k(x)[:,:T,:] 
c = (q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)) * (1.0 / 256)
c = c.masked_fill(self.copy_mask[:T,:T] == 0, 0)
c = c @ F.one_hot(idx, num_classes = self.config.vocab_size).float()       
x = self.head(x) + c
```

::: tip
Through exponential decay, RWKV-V2 achieved RNN-style inference: the model's current generation depends on the last output  and current input, while having a fixed-size hidden state (a and b in RWKV-V2).
:::

RWKV-V2's self-attention layer simplified expression:

$$
x_{t+1} = \sigma(Rx_t) \cdot \frac{ \exp(Kx_t) \cdot (V_xt) + \exp(W) \cdot a_t }{ \exp(Kx_t) + \exp(W) \cdot b_t }
$$

### RWKV-V3

RWKV-V3 is a short-term transitional version, which uses more comprehensive token-shift compared to that of RWKV-V2 (using different trainable TimeMix factors for R / K / V in SA and FF layers respectively):

```
xx = self.time_shift(x)
xk = x * self.time_mix_k + xx * (1 - self.time_mix_k)
xv = x * self.time_mix_v + xx * (1 - self.time_mix_v)
xr = x * self.time_mix_r + xx * (1 - self.time_mix_r)
```
Diagram of RWKV-V3's token-shift improvement compared to V2:

![RWKV-V3 token-shift improvement diagram compared to V2](../img/architecture/v2-vs-v3.png)

In addition, this version uses preLN instead of postLN (more stable while converges faster):

``` python
if self.layer_id == 0:
    x = self.ln0(x)
x = x + self.att(self.ln1(x))
x = x + self.ffn(self.ln2(x))
```

### RWKV-V4

RWKV-V4 is the **first official version** of the RWKV architecture, which is named "Dove". RWKV-V4 solved the numerical stability issues of the RWKV-V3 architecture. The first paper of the RWKV project [《RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era》](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048) is released at the same time.

The RWKV-V4 architecture paper was co-authored by RWKV author BlinkDL and the RWKV community, first published on May 22, 2023. In October of the same year, the RWKV-V4 architecture paper was accepted by [EMNLP 2023](https://2023.emnlp.org/program/accepted_findings/).

::: 

#### Token Shift Concept

The RWKV-V4 paper formally proposed the concept of "Token Shift": mixing each token with all previous token. This process is similar to a one-dimensional causal convolution with a size of 2. Token Shift allows the model to control how much new information and old information would be allocated to each head's reception, key, value, and gate vectors (i.e., $r$, $k$, $v$, and $g$).

The architecture diagram of RWKV-V4 language modeling demonstrates the Token Shift process of RWKV-V4 and the state-update process of RWKV:

![RWKV-V4 language modeling architecture](../img/architecture/rwkv-architecture-for-language-modeling.png)

::: note
A major feature of the RWKV-V4 version is that the state (RNN's hidden state) is very small, because BlinkDL focused on achieving the best performance with smallest state.

With $D$ as the main dimension of the model and $L$ as the number of layers of the model, the state size of the RWKV-4 model is $5DL$, including $2DL$ for mixing and $3DL$ for WKV.

### RWKV-V5

RWKV-V5 is an improved version of the RWKV-V4 architecture, codename "Eagle".

RWKV-V5 and RWKV-V6 architectures were released in the same paper [《Eagle and Finch: RWKV with Matrix-Valued States and Dynamic Recurrence》](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05892).

#### RWKV-V5 Architecture Optimization Details

Compared to RWKV-V4, the most important change in RWKV-V5 is the introduction of **multi-headed**, **matrix-valued states**, as described in the paper.

In RWKV-V4's time mixing computation, the parameters $u$, $w$, $k$, $v$ are all vectors with dimension $D$, and the head size is 1, resulting in a state vector with dimension $D$:

| $t$ | State $s_t \in \mathbb{R}^D$                                                                                                                              | Output $y_t \in \mathbb{R}^D$   |
| --- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 0   | $s_0 = \frac{u \odot k_0 \odot v_0}{u \odot k_0}$                                                                                                       | $y_0 = \sigma(r_0) \odot s_0$ |
| 1   | $s_1 = \frac{u \odot k_1 \odot v_1 + k_0 \odot v_0}{u \odot k_1 + k_0}$                                                                                 | $y_1 = \sigma(r_1) \odot s_1$ |
| 2   | $s_2 = \frac{u \odot k_2 \odot v_2 + k_1 \odot v_1 + w \odot k_0 \odot v_0}{u \odot k_2 + k_1 + w \odot k_0}$                                           | $y_2 = \sigma(r_2) \odot s_2$ |
| 3   | $s_3 = \frac{u \odot k_3 \odot v_3 + k_2 \odot v_2 + w \odot k_1 \odot v_1 + w^2 \odot k_0 \odot v_0}{u \odot k_3 + k_2 + w \odot k_1 + w^2 \odot k_0}$ | $y_3 = \sigma(r_3) \odot s_3$ |

RWKV-V5 splits $u$, $w$, $k$, $v$ into groups of vectors with dimension 64, where each group's $k$ and $v$ are multiplied through outer product to form a $64 \times 64$ **matrix**, which becomes a **head** of the state. The head size is fixed at 64.

The time-mixing steps for each head in RWKV-V5:

| $t$ | State $s_t \in \mathbb{R}^{64 \times 64}$                                                                                                                  | Output $y_t \in \mathbb{R}^{64}$ |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| 0   | $s_0 = \text{diag}(u) \cdot k_0^\top \cdot v_0$                                                                                                            | $y_0 = r_0 \cdot s_0$            |
| 1   | $s_1 = \text{diag}(u) \cdot k_1^\top \cdot v_1 + k_0^\top \cdot v_0$                                                                                       | $y_1 = r_1 \cdot s_1$            |
| 2   | $s_2 = \text{diag}(u) \cdot k_2^\top \cdot v_2 + k_1^\top \cdot v_1 + \text{diag}(w) \cdot k_0^\top \cdot v_0$                                             | $y_2 = r_2 \cdot s_2$            |
| 3   | $s_3 = \text{diag}(u) \cdot k_3^\top \cdot v_3 + k_2^\top \cdot v_2 + \text{diag}(w) \cdot k_1^\top \cdot v_1 + \text{diag}(w^2) \cdot k_0^\top \cdot v_0$ | $y_3 = r_3 \cdot s_3$            |

RWKV-V5 forward propagation (inference process) time-mixing calculation formula:

$$
\square_t = \text{lerp}_{\square}(x_t, x_{t-1}) W_{\square}, \quad \square \in \{ r, k, v, g \}
$$

$$
w = \exp(-\exp(\omega))
$$

$$
wkv_t = \text{diag}(u) \cdot k_t^\top \cdot v_t + \sum_{i=1}^{t-1} \text{diag}(w)^{t-1-i} \cdot k_i^\top \cdot v_i  \in \mathbb{R}^{(D/h) \times (D/h)}
$$

$$
o_t = \text{concat}(\text{SiLU}(g_t) \odot \text{LayerNorm}(r_t \cdot wkv_t)) W_o \in \mathbb{R}^D
$$

By transforming the vectors of RWKV-V4 into matrices, RWKV-V5's state calculation changes from "vector-based" to "matrix-valued states" with a dimension of 64×64, i.e., "matrix-valued states". Assuming the current RWKV model has a dimension of 512, it can be said that there are 512/64 = 8 heads (eight heads × 64 dimensions), which is the "multi-headed" concept of RWKV-V5.

Therefore, we can summarize the optimization details of RWKV-V5 as: **RWKV-V5 eliminates the normalization term (the denominator in the RWKV-V4 formula) and introduces matrix-valued states instead of the previous vector-valued states.**

In this way, RWKV-V5 cleverly expands the scale of the state, giving the RWKV model better memory and model capacity.

::: tip
With $D$ as the main dimension of the model and $L$ as the number of layers of the model, the state size of the RWKV 5/6 model is $66DL$, including $2DL$ for mixing and $64DL$ for WKV.
:::

#### RWKV-V5 Iteration Process

In fact, the research of the RWKV-V5 architecture was not achieved overnight. From its proposal in July 2023 to its finalization in September 2023, the optimization process of RWKV-V5 can be divided into three sub-versions: RWKV-5.0, 5.1, and 5.2.

**RWKV-5.0**

RWKV-5.0 redesigned the $wkv$ module of the RWKV-V4 architecture, where the $k$ and $v$ parameters were transformed from vectors with a dimension of $D$ to matrices with a dimension of 64 \* 64, so the $wkv$ state of RWKV-5.0 is 32 times larger than that of RWKV-V4.

The RWKV-5.0 architecture only released a 0.1B model: RWKV-5-World-0.1B-v1-20230803-ctx4096, which was still trained based on the World-v1 dataset from the RWKV-V4 period.

**RWKV-5.1**

RWKV-5.1 introduced a Time-mixing gating mechanism on the basis of RWKV-5.0, which is an additional matrix $W_g$ and a gating activation function SiLU were added to the time-mixing module.

The RWKV-5.1 architecture only released music models: RWKV-5-ABC-82M-v1-20230901-ctx1024 and RWKV-5-MIDI-560M-v1-20230902-ctx4096.

**RWKV-5.2**

RWKV-5.2 introduced diagonal decay matrices on the basis of RWKV-5.1, that is, the $u$ and $w$ vector parameters were diagonalized.

The RWKV-5.2 architecture released six types of models: 0.4B, 1B5, 3B, 7B, and 3B (ctx16k), which were trained based on the World-v2 dataset.

### RWKV-V6

The version code of RWKV-V6 is "Finch". This version was developed in October 2023 and is the currently (November 2024) stable architecture.

![RWKV-V6 Complete Architecture Diagram](../img/architecture/rwkv-6-architecture.png)

#### RWKV-V6 Architecture Optimization Details

RWKV-V6 introduced a dynamic recurrence mechanism based on LoRA, further optimizing the Token Shift and time-mixing processes.

RWKV-V5's Token Shift is similar to RWKV-V4, which is a very simple linear interpolation (lerp), and this linear interpolation is data-independent; parameter $\mu$ solely decide the proportion of the current token and the previous token mixed into the model input.

In RWKV-V5's Token Shift, the linear interpolation formula between $x$ and $x-1$ is as follows:


$$
\text{lerp}_{\Box}(a, b) = a + (b - a) \odot \mu_x
$$

---

RWKV-V6 borrowed the technology of low-rank adaptation (LoRA), replacing the static parameter $\mu$ with a dynamic LoRA: a trainable vector with a dimension of $D$ was introduced to $\mu_x$ and each $\lambda_\square$ , and a new trainable weight matrices was introduced to each $A_\square \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times 32}$, $B_\square \in \mathbb{R}^{32 \times D}$.

In RWKV-V6's Token Shift, the linear interpolation formula between $x$ and $x-1$ is as follows:

$$
\text{lora}_{\Box}(x) = \lambda_{\Box} + \tanh(x A_{\Box}) B_{\Box}
$$
$$
\text{ddlerp}_{\Box}(a, b) = a + (b - a) \odot \text{lora}_{\Box}(a + (b - a) \odot \mu_x)
$$

Compared to RWKV-V4/RWKV-V5, RWKV-V6's new Token Shift, which enhances data dependency, effectively expands the model's capabilities. The amount of new and old data allocated to each channel depends on the current input and output from last time steps.

::: tip
In general, this dynamic recurrence mechanism allows "important information" to effectively mark itself for use in subsequent tasks; while "unimportant information" can also mark itself so that model can reduce the probability of or completely avoid it entering the subsequent data flow, thereby reserving space for more important existing data.

In addition, if certain information is not useful for a specific task, the dynamic recurrence mechanism filtered out this information  in advance.
:::

RWKV-V6's dynamic Time Mixing calculation formula:

$$
\square_{t} = \mathrm{ddlerp}_{\square}(x_t, x_{t-1}){W}_{\square}, \quad \square\in \{r,k,v,g\}
$$

$$
d_t = \mathrm{lora}_d( \mathrm{ddlerp}_d ( x_t, x_{t-1} ) )
$$

$$
w_t = \exp(-\exp(d_t))
$$

$$
{wkv}_{t} =  \mathrm{diag}(u)\cdot k_{t}^\mathrm{T} \cdot v_{t} + \sum_{i=1}^{t-1}  \mathrm{diag}\left(\bigodot_{j=1}^{i-1}w_{j}\right) \cdot  k_{i}^\mathrm{T} \cdot v_{i}  \in \mathbb{R}^{(D/h) \times (D/h)}
$$

$$
o_t = \mathrm{concat}\left(\mathrm{SiLU}(g_t) \odot \mathrm{LayerNorm}(r_{t} \cdot {wkv}_{t})\right){W}_o \in \mathbb{R}^{D}
$$

$$
{wkv}' = {s} + \mathrm{diag}(u) \cdot k^\mathrm{T} \cdot v
$$

$$
{s}' = \mathrm{diag}(w) \cdot {s} + k^\mathrm{T} \cdot v
$$

The attention calculation of ${wkv}_{t}$ can be written recursively as:

$$
{wkv}' = {s} + \mathrm{diag}(u) \cdot k^\mathrm{T} \cdot v
$$

$$
{s}' = \mathrm{diag}(w) \cdot {s} + k^\mathrm{T} \cdot v
$$

Unlike RWKV-V5, $w_t$ in RWKV-V6 is not static throughout the sequence. This is the core change of RWKV-V6 decay: each channel of $w_t$ can change independently based on **data dependency**, whereas previously it was a fixed learning vector.

::: warning
The above new LoRA mechanism is used to obtain the mixing vector. Note that the LoRA process itself uses the Token Shift value in the style of Eagle (RWKV-V5) as input (the $\mu_x$ in the **bottom left of the RWKV-V6 complete architecture diagram**) rather than just the latest token. The new time-varying decay $w_t$ also needs to apply LoRA again.

Intuitively, this is a second-order variant of Token Shift, allowing each channel of $w_t$ to change based on the mix of the current and previous tokens, and the mix itself is determined by the embeddings of the two tokens.

#### RWKV-V6 Model Release

The RWKV-V6 architecture itself does not have sub-versions, but different types of models have been released, including base models pre-trained with different training sets, as well as Chinese novel and Japanese fine-tuned models. The following is an overview of models based on the RWKV-V6 architecture:

#### RWKV-V6 State Tuning

::: tip
In addition to the complete model weights, RWKV community developed state tuning during the iteration of the RWKV-V6 architecture. This is a novel fine-tuning method that fine-tunes the initial state of RWKV, which is equivalent to the most efficient prompt tuning.   This method is excellent at alignment because of its strong transferability. For detailed methods of state tuning, please refer to [RWKV-PEFT - State Tuning](https://github.com/JL-er/RWKV-PEFT/blob/main/scripts/demo-state-tuning.sh).

The fine-tuned state file can be merged into the base model or used as an "enhancement plugin for the RWKV model": that is, initializing the model's state before loading the base RWKV model to affect the model's response style, response format, etc.

RWKV officially released different types of **state files**:

### RWKV-V7

The architecture code of RWKV-7 is "Goose". RWKV-7 **surpasses the attention/linear attention paradigm**, its "state evolution" is very flexible, which can solve problems that attention cannot solve with the same computational cost. At the same time, RWKV-7 surpasses the TC0 constraint.

The research of RWKV-7 began in September 2024, and its preview version `RWKV-7 "Goose" x070.rc2-2409-2r7a-b0b4a`'s training code was first released at the [commit](https://github.com/BlinkDL/RWKV-LM/commit/e1d143f526e28be61fc06571034dda179101a683) of the RWKV-LM repository.

#### RWKV-7 Architecture Optimization Details

::: tip
RWKV-V7 adopts **Dynamic State Evolution**. Through a series of innovations (such as the Generalized Delta Rule), RWKV-7 comprehensively surpasses the Transformer and the previous RWKV-6 architecture in terms of computational efficiency, task performance, and model expressiveness.

On the premise that the training data is much less than that of open-source models such as Qwen2.5 and Llama3.2, the **language modeling ability** of the RWKV-7-World model has reached the state-of-the-art (SoTA) level among all open-source models with a scale of 3 billion parameters.

By introducing the Generalized Delta Rule, RWKV-7 can achieve the $S_5$ state tracking problem with a complexity of $NC^1$ using **only 2 layers**, and can recognize all regular languages using **4 layers**. Its expressiveness significantly exceeds the $TC^0$ limitation of Transformers.  
:::

In general, traditional attention mechanisms (such as the QKV-softmax-attention of Transformers) store multiple ${k, v}$ (key and value vector pairs) and use $q$ (query vector) to match the key to get the corresponding value output.

RWKV-7 does not directly store ${k, v}$ pairs but dynamically updates the state through computation, learning the relationship between key and value from the context, and then using the updated state to process new input $q$ (which is $r$ in RWKV) to get the output.

Specifically, the RWKV-7 model has an internal model $v ≈ k S^\top$. It needs to fit a simple objective: for given two vector sequences ${k_t}$ and ${v_t}$, transform $k_i$ into $v_i$ through $S$ (state), where the output $v$ needs to be as close as possible to the target $v$.

To achieve this goal, RWKV-7 automatically simulates dynamic gradient descent for the L2 loss function $\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \| v - k S^\top \|^2$ during inference, continuously training the internal model $v ≈ kS^\top$.

**Gradient formula for state:**

$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial S} = S k^\top k - v^\top k
$$

State gradient descent formula with weight decay $w_t$ and learning rate $η_t$:

$$
S_t = S_{t-1} \cdot \text{diag}(w_t) - \left( S_{t-1} k_t^\top k_t - v_t^\top k_t \right)  \text{diag}(\eta_t)
$$

Equivalent to:

$$
S_t = S_{t-1} \left( \text{diag}(w_t) - k_t^\top k_t  \text{diag}(\eta_t) \right) + v_t^\top k_t \text{diag}(\eta_t)
$$

Generalized formula for RWKV-7:
$$
S_t = S_{t-1}  \left( \text{diag}(w_t) + \text{a}_t^\top \text{b}_t \right) + \text{v}_t^\top \text{k}_t
$$

Where reasonable initial values are chosen as:

$$
\text{a} = -k ,\quad \text{b} = k \cdot \eta, \quad \text{v} = v, \quad \text{k} = k \cdot \eta
$$

## RWKV Architecture Features

The characteristics of the RWKV large model architecture include:

- Efficient and stable inference speed
- Low and fixed memory usage (supports running on CPU)
- Capable of handling infinite context, very suitable for long text processing and multi-round dialogue applications
- Hardware-friendly, only performs matrix and vector multiplication operations, no KV cache

The RWKV architecture consists of a series of stacked residual blocks, each of which consists of time-mixing and channel-mixing sub-blocks with a recurrent structure, which is achieved by linear interpolation between the current input and the last input (in the RWKV-4 architecture paper, this process is called token shift). RWKV 6 optimized the token shift process by borrowing LoRA technology, making the simple linear interpolation (lerp) of RWKV4/5 into a data-dependent, dynamic linear interpolation (ddlerp).

According to the comparison of the inference complexity of different models, the time complexity of Transformer is: O (T^2), and the space complexity is: O (T^2), so the inference speed will become slower and slower, and the memory consumption will also increase. The time complexity of RWKV is: O(T), and the space complexity is O(1). The RWKV large model achieves constant inference speed through the optimization of the calculation process, greatly reducing the time consumption during inference.

In addition, the RWKV architecture design significantly reduces memory usage, making the model efficient  on standard configuration CPUs or non-professional GPUs rather than expensive or high-end computing hardware. This breakthrough progress makes large-scale deep learning models no longer limited to specific hardware platforms, thus broadening the application range.

### RWKV-V8

RWKV-V8's architecture codename is "Heron."
RWKV-V8's first feature `DeepEmbed` was [announced](https://rwkv.cn/news/read?id=20250527) in May 2025. `DeepEmbed` can achieve excellent reasoning performance similar to MoE without consuming VRAM or even RAM, enabling truly sparse large models to be deployed on all edge devices.

#### RWKV-V8's DeepEmbed

DeepEmbed trains a learnable high-dimensional vector for each token in the vocabulary within the FFN of every model layer, which can be written as an Embed layer. These vectors can be learned during training and stored in RAM/SSD during inference, requiring only minimal parameter prefetching for each token, thus significantly reducing VRAM usage.

During inference, the model can prefetch the embedding vectors for the current layer based on the token index, which are used for channelwise multiplicative modulation (channelwise scaling) of the FFN output.

These token-based embedding vectors form a massive but sparse knowledge base that significantly enhances the model's ability to store and retrieve world knowledge. Although these vectors seemingly increase the model's parameter count, they **do not require VRAM**, and during training, they can avoid gradient synchronization bandwidth overhead in DP (Data Parallelism) through TP (Tensor Parallelism), and can be further offloaded to RAM or SSD.

In edge inference scenarios, these vectors can likewise be stored in memory or loaded on-demand directly from disk through mechanisms like `mmap`. Each token introduces only tens of KB of additional memory access overhead, making this mechanism highly suitable for deployment on edge devices.

**DeepEmbed Code Examples:**

Original ReLuSq FFN:

```
x = torch.relu(self.key(x)) ** 2  
return self.value(x)
```

DeepEmbed_1x ReLuSq FFN:

```
self.deepemb = nn.Embedding(d_vocab, d_emb)
...
x = torch.relu(self.key(x)) ** 2
return self.value(x) * self.deepemb(idx)
```

DeepEmbed_4x ReLuSq FFN (better performance, more parameters): 

```
self.deepemb = nn.Embedding(d_vocab, d_emb * 4)
...
x = torch.relu(self.key(x)) ** 2
return self.value(x * self.deepemb(idx))
```

::: tip
Since lookup operations do not consume VRAM during inference, these vectors are essentially "free" in terms of parameter count. Therefore, n-grams (such as `bigram`, `trigram`) can be further introduced to enhance the model's ability to model phrases/segments. If the vocabulary size is large, LoRA techniques can also be combined to reduce VRAM and training overhead.

## RWKV Architecture Features

The characteristics of the RWKV large model architecture include:

- Efficient and stable inference speed
- Low and fixed VRAM usage (supports CPU execution)
- Ability to handle infinite context, making it ideal for long text processing and multi-turn conversations
- Hardware-friendly design, performing only matrix-vector multiplications without requiring KV cache

The RWKV architecture consists of a series of stacked residual blocks, each composed of time-mixing and channel-mixing sub-blocks with recurrent structures. This recurrence is achieved through linear interpolation between the current input and the input from the previous time step (referred to as token shift in the RWKV-4 architecture paper). RWKV-6 optimizes the token shift process by borrowing from LoRA techniques, transforming the simple linear interpolation (lerp) of RWKV-4/5 into data-dependent, dynamic linear interpolation (ddlerp).

Comparing inference complexity across different models, Transformers have time complexity of O(T²) and space complexity of O(T²), resulting in increasingly slower inference and higher memory consumption. In contrast, RWKV has time complexity of O(T) and space complexity of O(1). Through computational flow optimization, RWKV large models achieve constant inference speed, dramatically reducing time consumption during inference.

Furthermore, the RWKV architecture design significantly reduces VRAM usage, enabling efficient model operation even on standard CPU configurations or non-professional GPUs, without dependence on expensive or high-end computing hardware. This breakthrough advancement removes the hardware platform constraints on large-scale deep learning models, broadening their application scope.
